// Creator Design Pattern

// Usage:
// The Creator design pattern is a design pattern that is used to create objects
// without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The Creator
// class is responsible for creating the objects and returning them to the client
// code. The Creator class is typically used in conjunction with the Factory Method
// design pattern.
